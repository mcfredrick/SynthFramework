# SynthFramework
 Basic template for building synths.

This project is in very early days. The aim of this little project was just to put together the basic structure of a synthesizer app using the JUCE framework and the Maximilian DSP library so that I can use the template for some future synthesizer projects. To that end, I plan to implement the most basic elements of a typical audio plugin in a reusable and intuitive way to facilitate further development. Stay tuned!
